## Geolocation

### Windows Geolocation API

Uses your computer's geolocation ability. No location data is stored, only used to get sunset/sunrise times.

### IP Geolocation

IP Geolocation powered by my [local-ip-geo](https://github.com/demosjarco/local-ip-geo) worker and [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/managed-transforms/reference/#http-request-headers) (the visitor location headers). No ip or location data is stored, only used to get sunset/sunrise times.
